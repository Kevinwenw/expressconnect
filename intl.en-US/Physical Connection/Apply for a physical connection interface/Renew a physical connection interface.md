# Renew a physical connection interface {#task_vzb_sl5_jhb .task}

We recommend that you renew your physical connection interfaces before they expire to avoid service disruptions.

If you no longer needs a physical connection interface, you can open a ticket to delete it.

If you do not renew your physical connection interface within 15 days after the bill becomes overdue, the interface is stopped. We recommend that you enable the auto-renewal function to ensure your interface is renewed on time.

**Note:** No resource occupation fee is charged if you use a shared port of NSP partners, which means that only a VBR is created under your account and no physical connection interface is applied.

1.  Log on to the [Express Connect](https://expressconnectnext.console.aliyun.com) console. 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Physical Connections** \> **Physical Connection Interfaces**.
3.  Find the target physical connection interface and check its status. Only interfaces in the **Enabled** state can be renewed.
