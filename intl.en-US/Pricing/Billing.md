# Billing {#concept_wtm_h1r_ydb .concept}

Express Connect only supports the Subscription billing method. Only the initiator router interface is charged and the receiver router interface is not charged.

**Note:** The Pay-As-You-Go billing method is used for creating a receiver router interface for multi-tenant VPC interconnection or physical connection. On the Pay-As-You-Go page, you can configure the receiver configurations, and do not need to pay for the receiver.

## Billing for a physical connection {#section_oc1_tyq_ydb .section}
