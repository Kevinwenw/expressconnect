# Methods for interconnecting VPCs {#concept_ns3_21l_wfb .concept}

## Overview {#section_ksy_2bl_wfb .section}

To meet different demands in different scenarios, Alibaba Cloud provides different products for connecting VPCs. You can use CEN or Express Connect to connect VPCs. We recommend that you use CEN because it is easy to configure and automatically distributes and learns routes.

-   [CEN](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/What is Cloud Enterprise Network?.md#)

    Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) is a service that allows you to create a global network for rapidly building a distributed business system with a hybrid cloud computing solution. CEN enables you to build a secure, private, and enterprise-class interconnected network between VPCs in different regions and your local data centers.

-   [Express Connect](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/What is Express Connect?.md#)

    You can create a peering connection to build an intranet communication channel between two VPCs.
