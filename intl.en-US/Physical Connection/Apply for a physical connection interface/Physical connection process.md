# Physical connection process {#concept_pbr_zfw_dfb .concept}

By using a leased line from your service provider, you can connect your on-premises IDC to an Alibaba Cloud access point to build hybrid clouds and expand your local network.

## Physical connection process {#section_djg_1hw_dfb .section}

As shown in the following figure, after connecting your on-premises IDC to the nearest Alibaba Cloud access point through a leased line from your service provider, you need to create a VBR for the leased line as a router between the local Customer-Premises Equipment \(CPE\) and the VPC. Then, you need to add the VBR to the Cloud Enterprise Network, or establish a peering connection between the VBR and the VPC so that the IDC can communicate with other VPCs.
