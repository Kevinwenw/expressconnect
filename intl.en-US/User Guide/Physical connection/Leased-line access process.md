# Leased-line access process {#concept_pbr_zfw_dfb .concept}

By using a leased line of your service provider, you can connect your local IDC to an Alibaba Cloud access point to build a hybrid cloud and expand your local network.

## Connection process {#section_djg_1hw_dfb .section}

As shown in the following figure, after you connect your local IDC to the nearest Alibaba Cloud access point through a leased line of your service provider, you need to create a Virtual Border Router \(VBR\) for the leased line as a router between the local Customer-Premises Equipment \(CPE\) and the VPC. After that, you need to establish a peering connection between the VBR and the VPC, and build a private-network connection between the local IDC and Alibaba Cloud.

The first step of a physical connection is to connect the leased line to an access point. You can apply for the connection on the Alibaba Cloud console or through one-stop access service.

## Self-service application {#section_gn5_4gw_dfb .section}

The process for self-service access application is shown in the following figure.

## One-stop access {#section_rrj_kzw_dfb .section}

The one-stop access service is provided by the service provider. You only need to provide the information about the leased-line access on the Alibaba Cloud console. The service provider will complete interface application, deployment, and leased-line access for you.
