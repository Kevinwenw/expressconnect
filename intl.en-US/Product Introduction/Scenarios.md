## Connect a local IDC to a VPC through a physical connection {#section_jr3_ywq_ydb .section}

If your local IDC needs to communicate with a VPC through a private network, you can use the physical connection function of Express Connect to implement private-network communication on both sides. You can establish a physical connection by yourself or by an Alibaba partner. With the physical connection, you can fulfill private-network communication with high quality, high reliability, and high security between your local IDC and the VPC. Express Connect allows you to accomplish private-network communication between two VPCs, eliminating the risk of network instability and data theft during transmission.
